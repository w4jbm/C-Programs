# C-Programs

Various programs in C.


## callsort.c

Demo of calling the Linux sort command from within a C program. Not particularly useful, but could be the starting point for something more elaborate.


## colors.c

A simple demo of the use of ANSI escape codes to change colors and attributes of text output to the console.


## dump.c

A simple program to create a traditional hex dump of a file. 


## num_guess.cpp

Nothing fancy, but all the "sample" programs I came across when I was playing around would end up in an endless loop if you entered something other than an integer as your guess.
