# C-Programs

Various programs in C.


## callsort.c

Demo of calling the Linux sort command from within a C program. Not particularly useful, but could be the starting point for something more elaborate.


## colors.c

A simple demo of the use of ANSI escape codes to change colors and attributes of text output to the console.


## dump.c

A simple program to create a traditional hex dump of a file. 


## num_guess.cpp

Nothing fancy, but all the "sample" programs I came across when I was playing around would end up in an endless loop if you entered something other than an integer as your guess.


## num2words.c

This takes an integer between 0 and 1,000 and converts it to words. (If you don't provide a number, it gives you 15 examples starting at a random point.)

This is similar to a program I used almost four decades ago to print checks for payroll and accounts payable applications I developed. You have to think through some of the quirks in how we word things.

It actually even gets at some interesting history of our number system if you think about it. We have "works" for the numbers 1 through 12. (Then we have the "teens".) At one point, 12 was an important number (and still figures into things like the number hours in half a day and the number of months in a year). Some fraction also have that property--we have one-half and one-quarter while the rest (like one-third or one-eigth) take "numbers" (in the examples, 3 and 8) and make use of them.

As I recall, I think my verion in BASIC went up to numbers as high as 9,999 which was a fair amount of money at the time. (Anything higher was something the company's owner wanted to know about anyway, so having to manually write the check provided a type of 'checks and balances'.)
